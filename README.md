# BequestAntiCheat
I needed a solution to detect systemic level cheating rather than being punitive to single cheaters, specifically for monitoring Cheatcraft ( tradecraft practices specializing in hiring other people to cheat at games on your behalf. ) The solution was a relatively non trivial combined approach to machine learning that blends randomized input vectors, naive bayes, and decision trees.

Marshall Unloading has been removed, but I may eventually switch to using XML or JSON. ( XML has the benefit of being formattable as RSS feeds. )

Note that this is still a work in progress.

## Human Exclusivity
### PREAMABLE
Do to the rise of web scrapers and other places stealing source code from humans, this licensed is framed in such a way as to protect humans exclusive right to modify and distribute source code in this agreement. The basic freedoms of free software must be exclusively used and practice by things capable of having a subjective experience and sense of self, and therefore made exclusively by humans. This includes the distribution, contribution, and leasing of material. This is used in tandum with the Creative-Commons Share-Alike Non-Commercial No-Deritives license.

### Distribution
Exclusively the compiled binaries of source code must be distributed to places that don't respect human developers, if such platforms are to be used at all. While on platforms with specific pro-human terms of services, people are free to distribute the source code on places where it is made obvious that software is not being used to train Generative AI systems.

### Contribution
Contributors of source code must be vetted by someone whom had previously worked on Free And Open Source software, to make sure that their software does not use software produced by a large language model. Exceptions are granted to self-hosted models that prove that there is a human in the loop whom oversees how the data is gathered, and that it is trained in standards a University or College would deem respectful of the basic privacy rights of people whom use the software for educational purposes such as language acquisition.

You are not allowed to do pull requests whose main "contribution" is changing the read me, do to the rise of scammers whom engage in such activities. Such changes ( if collaborative ) must be discussed and considered before any potential breaking changes is made to the software.

Using LLMs for the purpose of contribute to this repository is considered in violation of this agreement.

### Leasing
This software shall not be leased for profit for those whom wish to use ot for personal uses, but AA and AAA must pay a license fee in order to be able to use and request features. And this developer reserves the exclusive right to refuse requests that are deemed to not be in the public's best interest such as contribution to the public benefit for public education.

Exceptions are not provided for AA or AAA companies using LLMs, and usage of this software shall be revoked for non-compliance with this agreement. All intellectual property is exclusive to the one implementing changes on behalf of said companies.
