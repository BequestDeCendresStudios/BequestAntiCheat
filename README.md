# BequestAntiCheat
I needed a solution to detect systemic level cheating rather than being punitive to single cheaters, specifically for monitoring Cheatcraft ( tradecraft practices specializing in hiring other people to cheat at games on your behalf. ) The solution was a relatively non trivial combined approach to machine learning that blends randomized input vectors, naive bayes, and decision trees.

Marshall Unloading has been removed, but I may eventually switch to using XML or JSON. ( XML has the benefit of being formattable as RSS feeds. )

Note that this is still a work in progress.
